# Multi-Chain Wallet System Backend

A Deno-based backend service for managing multi-chain cryptocurrency wallets, supporting Ethereum and TRON networks.

## Features

- Multi-chain support (Ethereum, Tron, Bitcoin, Aptos, Sui...)
- Account management and generation
- Token operations (USDT transfers, sweeping)
- Password-protected administrative operations
- Balance checking and monitoring
- Network configuration management
- Comprehensive API documentation

## Prerequisites

- [Deno](https://deno.land/) version 1.x or higher
- Access to Ethereum and TRON networks (mainnet/testnet)
- Environment for secure key management

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd feather-multi-chain-wallet-system
```

2. Install Deno (if not already installed):
- macOS/Linux:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh
```
- Windows:
```bash
iwr https://deno.land/x/install/install.ps1 -useb | iex
```

## Running the Server

Start the server in development mode:

```bash
deno task dev
```

Start the server in prod mode:

```
deno task start
```

The server will start on port 8000 by default.

## Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT SECURITY ADVISORY**:
- Operations involving private keys should only be performed within internal networks for service-to-service interactions
- Currently, two types of APIs handle private keys:
  1. `/eth/sweep/*`
  2. `/eth/transfer/*`
- Implement proper security measures in production environments
- Never expose private key operations to public networks

## API Overview

The API is organized into several sections:

### System Status
- `GET /` - Check API status
- `GET /docs` - View API documentation

### Password Management
- `GET /set_env_password` - Set/update environment password
- `GET /check_env_password` - Verify password validity

### Token Management
- `GET /eth/add_token_address/:tokenAddress` - Add token address
- `GET /eth/remove_token_address/:tokenAddress` - Remove token address

### USDT Operations
- `GET /eth/sweep/usdt` - Sweep USDT to admin address
- `GET /eth/transfer/usdt` - Transfer USDT between addresses

### Network Configuration
- `GET /eth/set_network` - Set Ethereum network
- `GET /eth/set_min_balance` - Set minimum balance threshold
- `GET /eth/set_gas_for_sweep` - Set gas amount for sweep operations

### Account Management
- `GET /admin_gen` - Generate admin account
- `GET /acct_gen` - Generate new account
- `GET /accts_get` - List all accounts
- `GET /accts_get_with_balances` - Get accounts with balances

### TRON Operations(TBD)
- Various endpoints for TRON address management and transactions

For detailed API documentation, visit `/docs` endpoint after starting the server.

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes:
- 200: Success
- 400: Bad request
- 401: Unauthorized
- 404: Not found
- 500: Server error
